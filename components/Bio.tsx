        It all started 10 years ago, creating{" "}
        <span className="text-slate-50 font-semibold">HTML/CSS</span> pages for
        local small businesses and soon enough discovered{" "}
        <span className="text-slate-50 font-semibold">WORDPRESS</span> which got
        me into web development in the first place, months after I got recruited
        by an agency based in Leeds UK developing e-commerce website, web
        applications and solutions.

        I{"'"}ve been working as a freelance web developer for nearly a year now
        which gave me the opportunity to explore new technologies and chalenges,
        but mainly focusing on making{" "}

        When I am not making website I usually switch to my childhood dream
        which is developing videos games, and learning new languages.
